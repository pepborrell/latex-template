## [Unreleased]

## [5.0.0] - 2022-05-11

### Added

- GitHub Actions configuration (b847c85)

  This is supposed to replace the GitLab config.

### Changed

- GitLab references to point to GitHub instead (7a33ee3)
- Updated Python test suite from 3.7 to 3.10 (0733c83)
- Simplified `polyglossia` language loading (053b87d)
- Switched VSCode Remote Containers config from building to downloading image (4efd364).

  When new users first use this template, it is extremely frustrating for them to have to *build* the entire Docker image from scratch themselves, which can take very long.
  Simply download the existing one from DockerHub, which is much faster.

### Removed

- GitLab-specific content (config files, documentation, ...) (7a33ee3)
- Deprecated `chemmacros` `usechemmodule` macro (0909097)
- Profanity check in PDF test (0733c83)

- `matlab2tikz` improved alternative showcase using `pgfplots` (0910bca)
- Important badges of high importance for important information (d19b8d9)
- Hint on `parskip` usage to remove paragraph indentation in favor of vertical space (a292f6b)
- Support for *Acronyms* glossary title localization (86c0be1)
- New package for tables, `tabularray` (6825ff9, 480b400)
- Docker image source (merged in c584129)
- Additional math/unit font examples (2e3a582)

### Fixed

- Display of dimensionless quantities (5f8dc71)
- Tabular vertical excess white space (e5f983e)

### Changed

- usage of `chemmacros` over `chemformula` (e379fa9, c26d613)
- `siunitx` settings and usage to support [major version 3](https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx/blob/v3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#v300) (bb931a9, 4fc2caf, 6747a36, 190bc89, e83902a, 82977ce)
- Docker image source (b50eb6f, f10005e, 548dca9, a8fff45, afa8407, 3a0b4f0, a57a4ec)
- massive simplification/moving of README content (f8f4d3f, 2925463, 2840312, a99df09, bcb4d69)

### Removed

- Old files (6fbdc2e, 04eb8fe, 096331c, b37316d, cdc285d)

## [3.1.0] - 2021-03-12

### Added

- Toggle for inclusion of glossaries in the Table of Contents (ToC) (5c23bd0)
- Example for an appendix (d4a42ce)
- Translations for code listings in references, lists, captions (6148d55)

- Example for a new unit specification using `siunitx` (7a2d0d0)

### Changed

- Switched bibliography generation from vanilla Zotero to Zotero with its excellent **Better Bibtex** addon (a05f5f4)
- Fixed biblatex fields according to `biber --validate-datamodel` validation (eb068bd)
- Fixed using a system directory for `pandoc`, which required `sudo` privileges (no just user privileges) (d8f4c1c)

### Removed

- TeXGyrePagella font files: use those included in the TeX distribution itself (d74c2d9)
- Trailing whitespaces (WOW!) (d766fb6)

## [3.0.0] - 2021-02-03

### Added

- Option to suppress printing of pages list in the glossaries (b75d3d1)
- GitLab description templates (7038798)

### Changed

- Syntax highlighting now uses `minted` instead of `listings`, a backwards-incompatible change (19fbd87)
- Documentation now stresses Docker usage over manual "labour" (6843a2b)

### Removed

- Previous, custom-made `listings` language definitions; these are covered much better by `pygments`, aka `minted` (19fbd87)

## [2.0.0] - 2020-11-11

### Added

- Python-based tests for the produced PDFs (1746e4e).
  This allows the user to automatically run a test suite against the produced PDFs,
  for example checking for page count, metadata and much more.
- Makefiles for the [root](Makefile) and [tests](tests/Makefile) directories, while
  also swapping all CI routines over to use `make` (b4a9881).
  This allows for local as well as CI use using the same commands, and reduces coupling
  with the CI engine.
- Caching of files in CI, for much faster pipelines (while introducing some issues) (28aea76).
- Showcase and fixing of `\abs` macro for absolute values (4d0c6ff, bb11b72).

### Changed

- Git metadata display in the colophon (7c59cbe).

### Added

- Showcase for multiple lines with contours in TikZ overlay (ae4ad39)
- Hint for the `glossaries-extra` *Beginner's Guide* (d8b7fb4)
- Written permission (license) to use and distribute the [Fontin Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fontin-sans)
  font (cf79ee4)
- Summary for font licenses (0372475)
- Contributing guideline (56c4eac)
- README info on git and Docker (fa228b7)
- A `matlab2tikz` exported plot example (86dac19, c3e9b09)
- `YAML`-based configs for pandoc (cb39706)
- Proper check for the used TeX engine (de2a293)

### Changed

- Fontawesome implementation, away from the `fontawesome` package to the more
  modern `fontawesome5` (8df784e)
- Insertion of git metadata into the document (PDF metadata or into the printed text
  directly): now based on Lua (6d0cd7e)
- Also adjusted the README according to the new Lua implementation (ed946b8)
