# LaTeX template

This is the template I use for deliverables and all sorts of writing, mostly related to school.
It features a Docker environment and config files for VSCode to work with it.
It is intended to be used in local development, and includes GitHub action workflows to compile the documents on push.
Additionally, I include several templates that I use for the different use-cases.

The setup borrows heavily from [this amazing repo](https://github.com/alexpovel/latex-cookbook).
The setup files and part of the templates come from there.
Read the README and pdf file there for thorough explanations of all the functionalities this tool set provides.
