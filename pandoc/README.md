# Pandoc

`pandoc` is a tool almost completely separate from LaTeX, but goes hand-in-hand with it.
It is not relevant to the main project and used here only as an interesting showcase on how to convert Markdown READMEs to PDF (which uses LaTeX in the background).
This directory contains configuration files for `pandoc`.
