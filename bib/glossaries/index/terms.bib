% Encoding: UTF-8

In bib files, there are no comment characters (%).
However, any entry outside the regular (at)type{...} syntax is ignored.
This makes regular text "comments".
Further, bib2gls supports '%' as a comment character.

The labels cannot contain UTF-8 characters and must stay ASCII.
If such a word occurs, we must provide the name field separately and escape UTF-8.
Provide plural fields just in case they are ever required.

@index{tikz,
