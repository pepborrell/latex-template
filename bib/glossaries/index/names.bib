% Encoding: UTF-8

In bib files, there are no comment characters (like %).
However, any entry outside the regular (at)type{...} syntax is ignored.
This makes regular text "comments".
Further, bib2gls supports '%' as a comment character.

File explanation:
the labels cannot contain UTF-8 characters and must stay ASCII.
If such a word occurs, we must provide the name field separately and escape UTF-8.
Provide plural fields just in case they are ever required.


% Index entries do not need a 'name' field.
% if the entry label is printable, it can be used.
% An explicit name field is required for escaped characters (umlauts etc.)
