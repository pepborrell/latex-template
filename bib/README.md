# **Bib**liographical data

This directory contains:

1. The [bibliography itself](bibliography.bib).
    This is auto-generated using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
    Using citation management software (any will do) will help you out greatly in managing larger literature collections.
1. All sorts of [glossaries](glossaries/), which thanks to [`bib2gls`](https://ctan.org/pkg/bib2gls) now also come in `bib` format.
