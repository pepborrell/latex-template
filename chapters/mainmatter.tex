% Uncomment the following if you'd like vertical space (with no indentation) between
% paragraphs, instead of the default of *no* vertical space *with* indentation.
% This lives inside the main matter since for example the `mcolalttree` style for
% `glossaries-extra` (glossaries live in the front matter) is based around `\par`, which
% breaks if we request the `parskip` option.

% \KOMAoptions{parskip}
