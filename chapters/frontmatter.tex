% Helper file that pulls subchapters together.

% Set initial pages to alpha, so that they do not collide with later Arabic numbering
% in the generated PDF. This won't show in print because page numbers aren't displayed
% until later. But you will be able to print the title page by printing page 'a', which
% would otherwise overlap with page '1', aka the first actual text page.
\pagenumbering{alph}
\maketitle% Print main title page

\frontmatter% In KOMAScript, resets pagenumber, uses Roman numerals etc.

% Note that \subincludefrom{}{} cannot be nested, therefore us \subimport

\emph{
    The following styles do not contain page lists of the entries' occurrences,
    leading to a cleaner, more concise look.
    Refer to the source code on how to achieve this (which options and styles to use).
}

% For all sorts of styles, see also
% https://www.dickimaw-books.com/gallery/glossaries-styles/

% Simply pass the `nonumberlist` parameter where desired/required:
\printunsrtglossary[
    type=symbols,
    style=symbunitlong,
    nonumberlist,
]
\printunsrtglossary[
    type=numbers,

\printunsrtglossary[

    % If `nonumberlist` is passed, the `long3colheader` style simply leaves the
    % corresponding table cells *empty* (leading to an entirely empty column), but does
    % not actually remove the column. So use a different, but equivalent style
    % altogether:
    style=longheader,
    % The `longheader` style prints the page list behind the description, just not in a
    % separate column. So also explicitly suppress the generation of that:
    nonumberlist,
    title=\TransAcronyms{},
